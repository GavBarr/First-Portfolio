			<p>CSIS 1430 was a very enjoyable class to take and I am really happy that I decided to take it. I was a bit worried at first when I registered for the class, because I was taking other difficult classes along with it. The style of teaching helped me more than I thought it would, usually online courses have little to no guided learning but the format for this class was completely different. Designing websites and learning HTML, CSS and Javascript has been something that peaked my interest for awhile, but was intimidated by all of the elements/languages. After slowly learning and integrating everything together it all made sense. Even after completing this course I still have questions while working on my final project, but that's the whole point of coding. There is an endless amount of information that people can learn and while I conitnue my career I'll continuously be learning. Overall I think that this course was very beneficial not only for the topics learned but preparing me for future classes!</p>
